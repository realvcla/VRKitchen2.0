<img src="images/overview.png"/>

VRKitchen2.0 represents the new generation of Embodied AI platform that supports realistic physical interaction in photo-realistic scenes. 

## Nvidia Omniverse Backend

VRKitchen2.0 is based on Nvidia Omniverse, a new Nvidia infasructure that enables photorealistic rendering based on RayTracing, USD format support across all applications, state-of-the-art commercial physics engines, full python support, and full robotics planning interfaces and sensors with GPU accelerations.

## High Fidelity Physics

VRKitchen2.0 goes beyond abstract grasping and discrete states, and includes rich & continuous fluent changes for physical states. Realistic and meaningful tasks are also included to better leverage the physical system.
